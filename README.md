## NEM Data Challenge Winner

Back in July 2017, [NEM Solutions](http://nemsolutions.com) launched its 1st Data Challenge. The aim of the event was to identify wind energy and rail data processing professionals.

Worldwide participants were accepted and the best profiles awardeded. The first two stages were carried out online, and the last one consisted of a two-weeks internship at NEM Solutions. Further details can be found at www.nemsolutionsevents.com

The challenge was focused on the wind energy sector and in business oriented data.

### 1st Stage:
Each candidate received a CSV dataset of approximately 10GB. The file contained about 375 million rows of timestamp / variable / value (sampling frequency in seconds). The goal was to “horizontalize” the dataset calculating ten-minute averages. Once the file was processed, the participant had to make a data quality analysis in a graphical report allowing NEM to visually understand the quality of the processed data.

### 2nd Stage:
The candidates was asked to develop a module capable of predicting the energy production to a given weather forecast. To this effect, a 5 months historical dataset (SCADA + weather forecast) was provided.


In this Github repository you can find the Python scripts I used to solve the tasks proposed throughout the three Data Challenge phases together with the final reports submitted. 

Hope you find it useful,
