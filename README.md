## NEM Data Challenge Winner

Back in July 2017, NEM Solutions launched NEM Data Challenge. The aim of NEM Data Challenge was to identify worldwide wind energy and rail data processing profiles.

Worldwide participants were accepted and the best profiles awardeded. The first two stages were carried out online, and the last one consisted of a two-weeks internship at NEM Solutions. The financial costs of the stay was covered by Siemens Gamesa, Tecnalia and NEM Solutions.

The challenge was focused on the wind energy sector and in business oriented data. NEM was looking for profiles capable of processing data and to get value from it in order solve real problems. More information and contest rules can be found in: www.nemsolutionsevents.com or in the Wiki pages of this Github repository.

In the Github repository code section, you can find the Python scripts I used to solve the tasks proposed in the three data-challenge stages. Further description of the data challenge together with the final reports submitted at the end of each stage can be found in the Wiki section.

Kindest!
